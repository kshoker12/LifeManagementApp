# LifeManagementApp
An app used to optimize time management, live an organized and systematic life to achieve goals, and strive for self-improvement. 

**What will application do?**
Below are features listed on the main menu. 
- Ratings: A rating is a score associated with various personality traits and each day of the week, I assign a daily score for each trait and at the end of the week, a weekly average of the daily scores for the week is calculated and scaled by a factor depending on the magnitude of the overall rating and added to the total rating of the trait. The daily scores for the week for each trait can be viewed. 
- Responsibilities: Each Responsibility has tasks and each task has sub-tasks. Each of these can be created, removed, and edited. If a sub-task is finished, it can be checked off and if all sub-tasks of a task are completed, the task automatically gets checked off and is considered "completed". Each responsibility has a number of hours associated with it depending on how much time has been spent during the week, completing a task from this responsibility. 
- To-Do List: Each day, sub-task from various responsibilities can be added to a todo list and each task in todo list is either checked off or not depending on whether its completed or not. A sub-task can also be removed from the todo list. 
- Start Hour: The number of sub-tasks in todo list which can be completed in the next hour are displayed on the current work session and once hour has been complete, the successfully completed sub-tasks get checked off and their associated responsibilities' hours gets incremented. 
- Solutions: A problem can be added and each problem has a textbox which can be used to write down solutions to the problem and once the problem has been solved it can be checked off as "solved" and then can be removed from the problems list. A problem can be added and removed. 
- Weekly Compass: A Destination is a goal or outcome I wish to achieve by the end of the week and each destination has a number of points associated with it and up to 10 Destinations can be desired per week. At the end of the week, based on the level of satisfaction of my efforts towards achieving goal, I give myself a score over the total points associated with each destination and then a total percentage for the week is calculated automatically based on how many destinations I achieved which lets me know how focus I was that given week. 
- Daily Prompts: A daily prompt is a question I ask myself everyday and each prompt has a textbox which I use to answer question. There are also weekly prompts which are questions meant to be answered at the end of the week. Prompts can be viewed, added, edited, and removed. 

**Who will use it?**

I use this app to manage my own life but anyone who is looking to self-improve and live an organized life can also use this app. 

**Why is this application of interest to me?**

This app interests me because this made a massive life-changing impact on my life and allowed me to become a better version of myself because my life has been super organized and I've been able to hold myself accountable.
