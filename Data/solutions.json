            "solution": "I need to be really engaged in class. Sit at the front. Ask wise questions. Come prepared to each class.Make lecture affirmations. Meditatebefore class and enter flow state. Join the discord and advertise on that. Be very engaged in piazza. I must stay ahead in all my classes and get shit done. Stay on top of things. In class I will interact with everyone around me. Open random people. Hold strong eye contact. Let people recognize who I am and let my name be recognized in the class and associated with brilliance. I can make solid profit of this because this is a need for a lot of people. When helping people on piazza, help for free which will get people interested. Ask few questions but when I do, ask smart questions. This will improve my own grades and give me social proof for girls. This will help in many areas. Brainstorm more on this later on. Dealing with backlash from people who may think its wrong to sell notes, I need to just show the value i can provide and just let them know that its valuable and its not hurting anyone. Dont pay attention to naysayers since I need to become polarizing. It is important to have a good relationsip with the professsors as they will help mme bend the rules if there are rules opposing this. I need to advertise through word of mouth, associating with bunhc of people from the class, discords for the course, and piazza. Reddit might be a good source too. ",

No matter what happens to me, I know i will bounce back from it because I know how to deal with adversity. \n- work ethic: I am the hardest worker I know and if I really want something, i will do anything to obtain it. Go to crazy extreme's and the darkest depths. Im willing to go to war with circumstances. \n- Talking: I am a very good talker and i can make conversation with anyone as well as get what i want. I have a solid confident voice. \n- Confidence: I am very confident and im great at facing unfamiliar situatuons. When i talk, my confidence shines through and people can see that. I know that i can do anything. \n- Charismatic: I am very charismatic, i know how to leave a solid impression on everyone. I am polarizing and everyone respects me. Overtime i can gain anyones respect abecause i stay in my frame and no one can shake me off center. \n\nWEAKNESS'S\n- Easily attatched: I am very easy to get attached to someone if i like them. I start fantasizing about a life with them and dont even really get to know them very well. I can solve this by firstly, talking to mutliple girls at once and also staying indifferent. \n- Choke: When the stakes get high, i end up trying to do things consicously and end up making mistakes and choking. I put too much pressure on myself. I focus too much on avoiding the worst outcome and this manifests. Instead stay indifferent, get good self talk going and breathe. \n- ",
